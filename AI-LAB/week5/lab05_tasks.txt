1. Use BFS code to implement Uniform Cost Search Algorithm.
	-add extra check to explore only that node which has minimum cost
	-add extra list named as "visite_node" to avoid the same node visiting repeatedly.

2. Use DFS code to implement Depth-Limited First Search and Iterative Deepening First Search
	-write a function to find depth of given node
	-use this function for depth limited
